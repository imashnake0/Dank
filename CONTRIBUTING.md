## Pull Requests and Commits

* PRs are more than welcome, if you plan on working on a new feature, please open an issue to make sure it's viable and worth our time.
* Commit messages should essentially be sentences without periods; add the description if it makes sense to do so (sentence *with* a period). For example: `git commit -am "Commit message" -m "Commit description."`.
* Please add a PR description that clearly describes your changes, with links to relevant documentation, API references, etc.
